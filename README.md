June 13, 2024 updated Michigan Manufactured Housing Community App
Test site here: https://vwang.shinyapps.io/0613-test/

Shiny.io app runs slowly when several users (more than 2) are on the server. GitHub Pages is more ideal-- I am currently troubleshooting (6/13).
How to deploy to shiny.io:
rsconnect deploy shiny pathname --name vwang --title "title-name"
